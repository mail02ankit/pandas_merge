# Data wrangling datasets
In this project, I use *energy supply and renewable electricity production from the United Nations -energy data* from
the file "Energy Indicators.xls", *GDP data* from the file "world_bank.csv", and *Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data
for Energy Engineering and Power Technology* from the file "scimagojr-3.xlsx", and combine them into
a single dataset to do statistical analysis.

## Note
I use bitbucket for the version control as It provides free private repositories. If you want to get full development-history for this code, please email me on mail02ankit@gmail.com.

If you use this code, send me a pizza at mail02ankit@gmail.com
